# üìπ MediaPicker

As we know Apples UIPickerViewController provides us the functionality to select single image at a time, since our use case is to select multiple images we thought of building our own custom media picker. 

 ### Architecture

## **Implementation**

Implementation of MediaPicker is really easy and simple. So in-order to present Media Picker we initially need to create a configuration for it.

So there are two form of configuration in media picker. 


1. **MediaPicker System Config**

This involves the internal configuration required for Media Picker. We need to be very careful when selecting this configurations, since this would directly lead to app perfomance.


2. **MediaPicker Config**

MediaPicker config includes the System config along with basic configurations required for Media Picker. Eg: Selection Limit & Media types to fetch


Once you are done with the configuration, then you just need to present the MediaPicker. Now presentation of media picker includes two methods


1. **Delegation Based**

Here present the picker normally, and confirm to its delegate, and you will be able to use the necessary methods.

> Make sure you go through the code and understand what are the different types of configurations 

2. **Completion Based**

Here an extension is written for MediaPicker, which can be directly used to present it

Now all you need to do is configure your code as per the need.


> In our codebase, implementation of MediaPicker is done via **DeviceImagePicker.** So there is no need of direct implementation of the same.


## Under the hood ‚öôÔ∏è

Lets understand how under the hood Media Picker works with the following flow chart:

Initially Media Picker check for the **Authorisation** **status**, accordingly it takes the action. 
If Request is granted then the **MPStoreManager** will fetch all the assets and start rendering.
If request is not determined then it will ask for permission and finally if access is **restricted** it will throw error.
